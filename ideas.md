# BrowserOS Contribution Ideas

High impact and low effort contribution opportunities for new contributors.

## 1. Documentation Improvements (Highest Impact, Lowest Effort)

### Missing Build Documentation
- [ ] **Add Linux build instructions** to `docs/BUILD.md` - currently only covers macOS
- [ ] **Add Windows build section** to `docs/BUILD.md` with platform-specific requirements
- [ ] **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** with:
  - Development workflow and setup
  - Patch creation and testing guidelines  
  - Code review process
  - Testing procedures

### Enhanced Troubleshooting
- [ ] **Expand troubleshooting section** in `docs/BUILD.md` beyond current basic issues:
  - Common Chromium build errors and solutions
  - Platform-specific dependency issues
  - Patch application failures
  - Performance optimization tips for builds

## 2. Fix TODO Comments (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

Found several actionable TODOs in patches that need attention:

- [ ] **Fix state and filters issue** in `add-importer-supporter-for-chrome.patch:1517`
  - Location: `patches/nxtscape/add-importer-supporter-for-chrome.patch`
  - Comment: `//TODO: nikhil - fix state and other filters`

- [ ] **Implement text extraction** in `clash-of-gpts.patch:375`
  - Location: `patches/nxtscape/clash-of-gpts.patch`
  - Comment: `// TODO: Implement text extraction similar to third_party_llm_panel_coordinator.cc`

- [ ] **Fix viewport detection logic** in `new-snapshot-API.patch:1099`
  - Location: `patches/nxtscape/new-snapshot-API.patch`
  - Comment: `// TODO: Fix this logic. still not accurate in terms of saying if in view port or not`

- [ ] **Add focused attribute** in `browserOS-API.patch:197`
  - Location: `patches/nxtscape/browserOS-API.patch`
  - Comment: `// TODO: Add focused attribute when available`

## 3. Extension Improvements (Medium Impact, Low-Medium Effort)

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Remove console.log statements** from `resources/files/ai_side_panel/background.js` for production builds
- [ ] **Add error boundaries** and better error handling in extensions
- [ ] **Add input validation** and sanitization in extension forms

### User Experience  
- [ ] **Improve accessibility** in extension HTML files:
  - Add missing alt texts for images
  - Add ARIA labels for screen readers
  - Ensure proper focus management
  - Check color contrast ratios

- [ ] **Add loading states** and user feedback in extension UIs
- [ ] **Better keyboard shortcuts** documentation in extension manifests
- [ ] **Improve extension icons** and descriptions for better UX

## 4. Build System Enhancements (High Impact, Medium Effort)

### Build Validation
- [ ] **Add build validation scripts** to check patch compatibility before applying
- [ ] **Create pre-build checks** for required dependencies and environment setup
- [ ] **Add patch conflict detection** when multiple patches modify the same files

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Create development mode flag** to skip certain build steps for faster iteration
- [ ] **Add incremental build support** to avoid full rebuilds when only patches change
- [ ] **Improve error messages** in build scripts with actionable suggestions
- [ ] **Add build progress indicators** and time estimates

### Testing
- [ ] **Add automated testing** for the build process
- [ ] **Create smoke tests** for built binaries
- [ ] **Add regression testing** for patch applications

## 5. User Experience Quick Wins (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

### Information Display
- [ ] **Add version display** in the about/settings sections
- [ ] **Show build information** (commit hash, build date) in debug mode
- [ ] **Add changelog viewer** within the browser

### Interface Improvements
- [ ] **Better keyboard shortcuts** documentation and customization
- [ ] **Improve error messages** shown to end users
- [ ] **Add tooltips and help text** for complex features
- [ ] **Consistent branding** across all UI elements

## 6. Code Organization (Low Impact, Low Effort)

### File Structure
- [ ] **Add file headers** with license and description information
- [ ] **Organize build scripts** into logical modules
- [ ] **Create utility functions** for common operations
- [ ] **Add code comments** explaining complex patch logic

### Configuration
- [ ] **Create example configuration files** for different build scenarios
- [ ] **Add environment variable documentation**
- [ ] **Standardize naming conventions** across the codebase
